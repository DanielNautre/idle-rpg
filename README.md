# Idle RPG

Idle RPG is a Idle game, a game that plays itself
It's based upon vague memory I have from a similar game that I had years ago.

On Idle games:

What you often see labelled Idle games, aren't really idle games because they require you to interact with the game to make progress. The correct name is Incremental games. Because the gameplay consist in incrementing stuff to progress.

Idle RPG is really an idle game because once, the game starts, you have no way of influencing it. The game plays itself.

## Hero

### Attributes

There are 4 main attributes

Strength
Intelligence
Dexterity
Vitality

### Stats

#### Blocking / Evasion

Blocking (called Evasion for the Archer) allows the Hero to avoid being hit by the ennemy.
It is hard capped a 75% chance of blocking and takes dexterity, Hero level and the gear bonus into account
Only shields, bows and crossbows provide a bonus towards Blocking / Evasion

#### Armor

Armor allows the player to absorb part of the damage received. It is hard capped a 90% meaning that no matter how much armor the player has, it will take at least 10% of the damage or 0.1 damage.
Armor is complemented by a secondary stat: Armor effectiveness. 
This determines how effective armor is. e.g.

10 armor at 80% effectiveness will absorb up to 8 damage. The player will take 2 damage
5 armor at 50% effectiveness will absorb up to 2.5 damage. The player will take 2.5 damage

Armor effectiveness depends on the Hero's class
