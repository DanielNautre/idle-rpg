# Idle RPG

Idle RPG is a Idle game, a game that plays itself
It's based upon vague memory I have from a similar game that I had years ago.

On Idle games:

What you often see labelled Idle games, aren't really idle games because they require you to interact with the game to make progress. The correct name is Incremental games. Because the gameplay consist in incrementing stuff to progress.

Idle RPG is really an idle game because once, the game starts, you have no way of influencing it. The game plays itself.

## Gameplay

None

Well none involving the player.

## Hero

### Attributes

There are 4 main attributes

Strength
Intelligence
Dexterity
Vitality

### Stats

#### Blocking / Evasion

Blocking (called Evasion for the Archer) allows the Hero to avoid being hit by the ennemy.
It is hard capped a 75% chance of blocking and takes dexterity, Hero level and the gear bonus into account
Only shields, bows and crossbows provide a bonus towards Blocking / Evasion

#### Armor

Armor allows the player to absorb part of the damage received. It is hard capped a 90% meaning that no matter how much armor the player has, it will take at least 10% of the damage or 0.1 damage.
Armor is complemented by a secondary stat: Armor effectiveness. 
This determines how effective armor is. e.g.

10 armor at 80% effectiveness will absorb up to 8 damage. The player will take 2 damage
5 armor at 50% effectiveness will absorb up to 2.5 damage. The player will take 2.5 damage

Armor effectiveness depends on the Hero's class


### Classes

#### Paladin

The Paladin starts with higher Vitality and Strength and has a bonus to healing potion.
He is the only class who can equip a shield which increases his Block chance
he also has the highest armor effectiveness: 80%


#### Wizard

The Wizard start with higher intelligence and has already learned a spell: Firebolt
It cannot wear a shield and can only equip Swords and Staves as weapons
It has the lowest armor effectiveness: 50%


#### Archer

It is the only class who can use bows and crossbows which may provide a bonus to evasion

Your Hero may use a variety of gear. While most of the gear can be used by any classes, there are exceptions.

Bows and Crossbows can only be used by archers, Staves can only be used by Wizards and Shields, Axes, Maces, Flails can only be used by Paladins. Sword may only be used by Wizards and Paladins.

Starting at level 3, your Hero can find enchanted gear. and at level 10 you'll find gear with more enchants.


### Death

Your Hero is not immortal, and he might fight an ennemy that is too strong for him. In which case, you have two options:

* Reload the latest save: with some luck, your Hero might survive this time
* Start a new character


## Ennemies

### Type

Ennemies can be of several types:

* Undead
* Demon
* Animal

### Kill

Once you have dealt enough damage to kill an ennemy you will be rewarded with experience points (xp) and gold.

### Loot

Once an ennemy has been disposed of, you will be able to loot its body. There is a 1 out of 6 chance to find something. 


## Locations

### Home

This is the place where the adventure starts. There isn't much to say: When you first start a character, you'll be at his home which he will promptly leave and never visit again.

### Town

Every once in a while you Hero may go back to town where he will perform a number of actions:

* Visit the Healer to restore his health
* visit the Enchanter to restore his mana
* Sell the gear he found and do not want to use
* Buy Health and Mana potions

### Dungeons

Dungeons are generately randomly from a predefined list. When travelling, your Hero has a certain chance of stumbling upon a dungeon.
Your Hero will always enter them when he finds them.
Dungeons are generated based on your Hero's level.

#### Unique Dungeons

Every time a new dungeon is generated, there is a small chance it will be a unique dungeon. Unique dungeons have their own name and will generally feature a unique boss in the last room.

## Items

### Gear

### Potions

The game feature two main potion types: Health and Mana

These come in 10 different sizes depending on how much Life/Mana they regenerate. 
How many potions the Hero can hold on to depends on whether or not he wears a belt and the level of his belt.
The Hero can carry up to 8 potions of each type with a level 10 belt
